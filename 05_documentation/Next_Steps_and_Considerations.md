# Next Steps and Considerations

This document outlines the upcoming tasks and important considerations for the Provider Data Consolidation project.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Continue Working with the Combined Dataset**
   - Use the consolidated `working_pulse_v1.csv` file for all further data transformation and standardization
   - Standardize remaining fields according to business requirements
   - Consider additional column cleanup or renaming for clarity

2. **Salesforce Picklist Mapping**
   - Map all provider attributes to standardized Salesforce picklists
   - Create crosswalk tables between source system values and Salesforce values
   - Implement validation checks to ensure all mapped values exist in picklists
   - Focus first on the most critical fields: Credentials, Gender, Ages Treated, and Treatment Modalities

3. **Field Formatting and Standardization**
   - Standardize phone number formats across all providers
   - Ensure location information is consistently formatted
   - Normalize specialties and treatment modalities listings
   - Address any inconsistencies in the "Additional Considerations" field

4. **NPI Lookup & Validation**
   - Validate existing NPIs against the NPPES registry
   - Research and add missing NPIs for providers without them
   - Create a documented process for NPI verification

5. **Comprehensive Data Validation**
   - Perform consistency checks across all data fields
   - Validate phone numbers, emails, and web addresses
   - Ensure all required fields have appropriate values
   - Identify and handle duplicate records

6. **Airtable Base Preparation**
   - Design the final Airtable schema based on the data restructuring plan
   - Create appropriate tables with linking fields
   - Set up views and filters for different use cases
   - Document the schema design and relationships

## Technical Considerations

- **Data Volume Management**: Ensure processing scripts can handle the full dataset efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in all data processing scripts
- **Versioning**: Maintain version control of processed datasets to track changes
- **Audit Trail**: Document all data cleaning decisions and transformations

## Long-term Maintenance

- **Data Refresh Process**: Establish a process for updating the Airtable base with new data
- **Change Management**: Define how changes to Salesforce picklists will be propagated to the Airtable base
- **Data Governance**: Establish rules for who can modify the data and under what circumstances
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement periodic data quality checks to maintain integrity

## Integration Considerations

- **Salesforce Sync**: Consider how this data will remain in sync with Salesforce
- **Website Integration**: Plan for how provider data will feed into the public website
- **API Access**: Determine if an API will be needed to access the provider data programmatically

## Documentation Needs

- **Data Dictionary**: Create a comprehensive data dictionary for all fields
- **Process Documentation**: Document all data processing steps for future reference
- **User Guide**: Develop guidelines for using and maintaining the Airtable base
